# TCNet: Continuous Sign Language Recognition from Trajectories and Correlated Regions
This is the codebase for our paper [TCNet: Continuous Sign Language Recognition from Trajectories and Correlated Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11818), the repository is based on [TLP](https://github.com/hulianyuyy/Temporal-Lift-Pooling) and [CorrNet](https://github.com/hulianyuyy/CorrNet), as we use the same feature extraction backbone, sequential modeling and classifier.

## Installation

we are sorting out the environment and codes, details will come soon!
